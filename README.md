# 🌍 Analyzing Global Happiness Trends and Factors (2015–2023)

## 🎯 Overview

This project explores how various **economic and social factors** — such as **GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption perception** — influence **global happiness levels** between **2015 and 2023**.

Using **data visualization**, **statistical analysis**, and **interactive dashboards**, this analysis aims to identify the happiest regions, observe global trends over time, and determine which factors most strongly correlate with happiness.

---

## 🧭 Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

* Analyze **global happiness data** collected over nine years (2015–2023).
* Explore **regional and economic differences** in happiness.
* Identify **key drivers** that influence happiness levels.
* Visualize insights using **Tableau** and **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**.

## 🚀 Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Combined multiple years of World Happiness data.
   * Handled missing values and standardized columns.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visualized global trends in happiness scores.
   * Compared happiness by region and income level.
   * Examined relationships between GDP, social support, and happiness.

3. **Visualization & Dashboarding**

   * Built an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to explore happiness factors dynamically.
   * Added color, size, and trend features to visualize insights clearly.

4. **Insights & Findings**

   * Higher GDP and social support generally lead to higher happiness.
   * Northern and Western Europe remain consistently among the happiest regions.
   * Some regions show improvement in happiness over time, while others decline due to economic or social instability.
